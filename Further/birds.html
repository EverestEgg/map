    <p>
     The parks have become a popular spot for bird watchers and photographers,
      and bird hides have been installed to help facilitate these
       activities. I have certainly seen people wandering around with
        the massive lenses optimal for bird photography.

The lakes were designed as a haven for native and migratory birds, 
with dead gumtrees installed around the lake specifically for roosting.
 And it has become a haven for them in the surrounding urban environment.
  Over 160 bird species have been recorded in the park by the Friends 
  of Newport Lakes since in 1986. With most of them being common water 
  birds, with a few rear sitings of the Swift Parrot among others.
