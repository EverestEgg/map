    <p>
      Welcome to Newport Lakes,
       a place that holds a very special place in my heart.  
       If you entered through the carpark, you would have seen the duck stature 
       at the entrance. Diver, made by Simon Perry. made from reclaimed bluestone, 
       a reminder of the quarry this place used to be, as well as the conservation 
       efforts that turned the place into a sanctuary for many bird species.  
<br><br>
If your right at the entrance where I took the main photo,
 from here there are many ways you can go. Further into the reserve
  where you will come across the titular lakes. Or walk along the gravel 
  road that travels along the side of the reserve and the grass. Or perhaps
   into the grass field, with its dog park and playground, there may even be 
   a birthday party happening right now, it is a popular spot for them.  

    </p>
