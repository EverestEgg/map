    <p>
     This playground is a populer spot for children birthday parties,
      I have been and had my fair share of them hear. The BBQ’s
       covered seating and large amount of play space makes it a 
       perfect spot.  
<br><br>
This area is called Pavey Park and is less suited for the natural 
oasis that the Lakes area has become. While is started life as a
 quarry called Pavey’s hole like the lakes, it then got repurposed
  into Pavey’s Tip in 1975 till 1882.  It was one of the first areas
   rehabilitated and in 1989 it was opened as Pavey park. Originally 
   it was planned to be like CERES, but those plans fell through,
    and it became a mowed grass playground area, though small areas 
    of native planning have been done in the area.
